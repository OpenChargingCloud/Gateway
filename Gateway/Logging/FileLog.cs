    /// The console shows what is happening to whoever is watching, and the web
    /// interface keeps the last two thousand entries for whoever asks. Both are
    /// gone when the process is: a console that was not being read kept
    /// nothing, and the ring buffer empties with the gateway. Everything that
    /// wants answering afterwards - what a station replied at four in the
    /// morning, what the clock did last week, which discovery preceded the
    /// session that failed - needs a third place, and this is it.
    ///
    /// One file per day, named for the date, appended to and flushed after
    /// every entry. Flushing every time costs a system call per entry and buys
    /// the property that matters here: a gateway that is killed, or that
    /// crashes, has its last lines on disk rather than in a buffer. The volume
    /// this writes - a busy charging session is a few thousand lines - makes
    /// that trade an easy one.
    ///
    /// Nothing is ever deleted. A simulator that quietly threw away the
    /// evidence of the run somebody is asking about would be worse than one
    /// that needs a directory emptied now and then.
