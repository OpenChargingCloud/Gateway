 * read, and a list that grows downwards makes them chase it. The filters work
 * on what is already in the browser, so changing one costs nothing and asks
 * the gateway for nothing. A list that is scrolled to the top follows along;
 * scrolling down stops that, which is what somebody reading an older line
